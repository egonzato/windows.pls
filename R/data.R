#' Beer Dataset from Near Infrared Spectroscopy
#'
#'The beer dataset contains 60 samples published by Norgaard et al. Recorded with a 30mm quartz cell
#'on the undiluted degassed beer and measured
#'from 1100 to 2250 nm (576 data points) in steps of 2 nm.
#'A good playing ground for regression methods starting from spectral intensities.

#' A data frame with 80 rows and 577 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{y}{Original extract concentration}
#'   \item{xtrain}{Intesities measured on 576 different data points}
#' }

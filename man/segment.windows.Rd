\arguments{
\item{xblock}{A matrix containing one spectra for each observation.}

\item{yblock}{A vector containing the concentration associated to each spectra in the \emph{xblock} matrix.}

\item{windows}{Number of windows the spectra has to be divided in.}

\item{fade}{Opacity of the window.}

\item{xlab}{Title of the x axis.}

\item{ylab}{Title of the y axis.}

\item{title}{Title of the plot.}

\item{legend}{Name of the substance which drives the gradient of spectraâ€™s mapping.}

\item{grad}{Number of colors that are used to build the gradient.}
}
\value{
Plot of spectra in which segments have a different background color.
